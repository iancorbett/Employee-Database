# Employee-Database

This project was an on the job ticket. This means that I was given starter code, in html, css, and javascript files. However the starter code only provided the visual aspects of the site. While the javascript file did contain some functions, it was up to me to make the site function properly, and do what it was created to do. I am making this project in order to learn more about javascript, and using functions. In this projects I used javascript functions to make the website interactive. Firstly, I had to add a pop up window with prompts that ask a series of question about employees. Then I have to add employees to the "database" so they they can be searched through. Then I have to use javascript to make various calculations that an employer would typically make.

This project was made not so much to practice setting up, laying out, and decorating websites, but moreso to practice making an alread made website interactive. In this project, I learned a lot about 

Throughout building this project, there have been many bugs that have had to be dealt with.

What I did:

The website is quite simple. There is an add employee button, that wehn it is clicked, prompts a seies of questions to search through a databse of employees. Overall, I believe that this is a site that is quite easy to use.
