# Employee-Database

This project was an on the job ticket. This means that I was given starter code, in html, css, and javascript files. However the starter code only provided the visual aspects of the site. While the javascript file did contain some functions, it was up to me to make the site function properly, and do what it was created to do. I am making this project in order to learn more about javascript, and using functions. In this project I used javascript functions to make the website interactive. Firstly, I had to add a pop up window with prompts that ask a series of question about employees. Then I have to add employees to the local storage. Then I have to use javascript to make various calculations that an employer would typically make. The results of the calculations can be viewed in the console. These calculations include calculating the average salary, as well as choosing a random employee to win a drawing.

This project was made not so much to practice setting up, laying out, and decorating websites, but moreso to practice making an alread made website interactive. In this project, I learned a lot about forms and tables, how to organize them, and how to use them to display data on web pages.

Throughout building this project, there have been many bugs that have had to be dealt with. Additionally, I learned a lot about local storage and how to use JSON. I also learned about other concepts such as while loops. In adding event listeners.

The main bug that I dealt with was that I could not get the forms to work correctly. When trying to accept user input, I ran into a few errors. As it is now, the form still doesn’t work perfectly. for example, The application is currently not able to add more than one employee at a time. However, whenever I attempted to solve this, it created other issues. for example, often times it would create two duplicate employees in the local storage. additionally I adjusted where the functions were sometimes it would cause there to be an infinite loop of prompts no matter how you respond to prompt prompts would constantly appear. I did not resolve this issue but I do believe that I made it as functional as possible. The other main difficulty that I ran into was getting the employees to save into the local storage before meeting with the tutor. I didn’t quite understand that you needed to save all of the employee objects into the local storage and use JSON to store it as a string. I was saving it in an array and thought that that would work, but I learned that it needed to be in the local storage. Additionally, it was difficult to decide where to put the break commands, when working on the prompt section.

The website is quite simple. There is an add employee button, that when it is clicked, prompts a seies of questions. The answers to these questions are stored as properties of the employee object. Each employee object is pushed into an employee array, and stored in local storage. We use Json to turn the input into a string, and then ultimately we pull the data in local storage and display it in the chart. Overall, I believe that this is a site that is quite easy to use.

CREDITS: 
Although I did not directly copy and paste any code from another source, I did receive quite a bit of help from a tutor named Dennis Itau. The section that he helped me on was the local storage section specifically he helped me with 78 line 98 and also line 120. Before hand, I did not have the return employees typed it line 120 and it was causing all sorts of errors in my code. He noticed this issue and told me that I needed to return the employees and alleviated some of the errors additionally, he helped me online 124 essentially he helped me store all of my employee objects into the local storage and then take them out of the local storage and get them printed onto the chart. Additionally I did get some help from my teacher named Luigi. He helped me on the section where we have to display the average salary the employees during office hours. I was trying to purely use arithmetic to solve the average salary, but Luigi gave me the idea of using a for loop to iterate through all of the employees and their salaries. He gave me the idea to set a total equal to zero, and then add the employee salaries onto this total and then divide by the length of the employees array. Although the exact code that he worked on with me, ultimately got changed after working with Dennis, I still got the idea for using the loop from Luigi so I thought it was worth mentioning that he had helped me on this section.
